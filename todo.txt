â€¢ write a routine to automatically pick the pattern with least penalty
â€¢ data entry ðŸ¥³ tables!! ðŸŽŠ ... specifically:
    - error correction characteristics (pg. 41)
â€¢ penalty routine still mysterious - do more troubleshooting
â€¢ update penalty functions to not use get_row()
â€¢ mode overhead calculation for when to switch modes
â€¢ file read/write capability
â€¢ command line arguments
â€¢ remainder bits

going through the standards doc:
â€¢ data modes, mode switching (pg. 22)
    mostly done!! great job me!! kanji and ECI remain
â€¢ symbol encoding example (pg. 90)
â€¢ bitstream optimization  (pg. 92)

PITEOG stuff:
â€¢ deprecate the continuous-data "Img" type?
â€¢ update get_row() to handle sizes >128 (versions 28 and onward)
    idk if this is necessary
