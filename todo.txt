â€¢ work on bitstream.rs, replicate the function of first_qr_code()
â€¢ data entry ðŸ¥³ tables!! ðŸŽŠ ... specifically:
    - bit lengths of character count indicators (pg. 24)
    - remainder bits (see notes, pg 21)
    - data codewords as function of version / error correction (pg. 34)
    - error correction characteristics (pg. 41)
    - version info (pg. 85)
â€¢ penalty routine still mysterious - do more troubleshooting
â€¢ update get_row() to handle sizes >128 (versions 28 and onward)

going through the standards doc:
â€¢ data modes, mode switching (pg. 22)
â€¢ codeword blocks (pg. 52, refer pg. 54)
â€¢ version information (pgs. 61, 84)
â€¢ symbol encoding example (pg. 90)
â€¢ bitstream optimization  (pg. 92)

PITEOG stuff:
â€¢ replace the "polynomial" type with the "codewords" type (convert functions, etc)?
â€¢ deprecate the continuous-data "Img" type?
