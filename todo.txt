â€¢ work on bitstream.rs, replicate the function of first_qr_code()
â€¢ data entry ðŸ¥³ tables!! ðŸŽŠ ... specifically:
    - error correction characteristics (pg. 41)
â€¢ penalty routine still mysterious - do more troubleshooting
â€¢ update penalty functions to not use get_row()
â€¢ mode overhead calculation for when to switch modes

going through the standards doc:
â€¢ data modes, mode switching (pg. 22)
    mostly done!! great job me!! kanji and ECI remain
â€¢ codeword blocks (pg. 52, refer pg. 54)
    table is done and very probably accurate. now i only need the shuffling code
â€¢ symbol encoding example (pg. 90)
â€¢ bitstream optimization  (pg. 92)

PITEOG stuff:
â€¢ deprecate the continuous-data "Img" type?
â€¢ update get_row() to handle sizes >128 (versions 28 and onward)
    idk if this is necessary
