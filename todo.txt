• remainder bits
    this might not be necessary since it works implicitly
    (though might be good to add explicit bounds checking)
• check to see if arbitrary data is possible (emoji, etc) - utf-8?
• add stats printing (version, bit count, etc)
• add comments and documentation so it's readable to others
• restructure code to be divided into logical sections:
    data conversion
        badstream type + operations
    error correction
        polynomial type
        galois field
        reed-solomon
    graphics
        bitmap type + operations

going through the standards doc:
• data modes, mode switching (pg. 22)
    mostly done!! great job me!! kanji and ECI remain

~~~~~~~~~~~~

example stats output i want:

Encoding input "hello123hello" at error correction level H
Message compression 13% (104 bits -> 94 bits)
Version 3 chosen (width 29 px):
| Message    | Padding    | Error correction    |
| 12 bytes   | 4 bytes    | 10 bytes            |
Mask 4 chosen (97% of avg. penalty)
Saving as out.xbm
