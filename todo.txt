• mode overhead calculation for when to switch modes
• remainder bits
    this might not be necessary since it works implicitly
    (though might be good to add explicit bounds checking)
• check to see if arbitrary data is possible (emoji, etc)
• clean up code (remove the allow(dead_code))
• add stats printing (version, bit count, etc)

maybe:
• penalty routine still mysterious - do more troubleshooting
    idk if i need to, it's kind of a technicality whether it works right or not

going through the standards doc:
• data modes, mode switching (pg. 22)
    mostly done!! great job me!! kanji and ECI remain
• bitstream optimization  (pg. 92)

PITEOG stuff:
• deprecate the continuous-data "Img" type?
• update get_row() to handle sizes >128 (versions 28 and onward)
    idk if this is necessary
